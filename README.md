# PHASE-4-PROJECT
Image Classification with Deep Learning: This repository shall host my Data Science Project on how to build a deep neural network that trains on a large dataset for classification on a non-trivial task. Task is to build a model that can classify whether a given patient has pneumonia, given a chest x-ray image.
